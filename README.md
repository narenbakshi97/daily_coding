## 3. Date: 21 Jan 2019
Started making a simple Pokemon fighting game, similar to Pokemon Simulator using JSON, JS and HTML

## 4. Date 22 Jan 2019
Continued to work on the Pokemon game and added functionalities like catching a Pokemon, using API instead of hard coded data, Shopping pokeballs, etc. variables.

Game is almost finished, only thing which is pending is to evolve your pokemon and release functionality, will figure out later how to use the evolution chain  and etc. resources.
